# BeSpoked Bikes Exercise

I've added code that would hypothetically be implemented for backend/database. Unfortunately, my computer in it's current state is not actually able to run MySQL (due to being old, low on storage, and in dire need of replacement) and I was unable to find any alternative.
I've instead added functionality in the frontend to simulate what would happen, and as I mentioned before added hypothetical (untested) code.
