Delete all extra files & upload to github
clean the data file

Database. How?

Update/add product/sales/etc.

UML diagrams?

update readme to be more in depth?

cleanup infopage

remember sales in the DB is a lot of ints, NOT strings

update instead of add

talk abt how the pushing, etc. is a bit wonky and inefficient. would have liked to fix that
(i.e. not calling all data every time, although that's a side effect of not having sql)
